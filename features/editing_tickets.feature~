Feature: Editing Tickets
  Scenario: Editing A Ticket
    Given there is a project called "Textmate 2"
    And that project has a ticket:
      |title                        |description                               |
      |Make it shiny!               |Gradients! Starbursts! Oh My!            |
    Given I am on the homepage
    When I follow "Textmate 2"
    And I follow "Make it shiny!"
    When I follow "Edit Ticket"
    When I fill in "Title" with "Make it really shiny!"
    And I press "Update Ticket"
    Then I should see "Ticket has been updated."
    And I should see "Make it really shiny!" within "#ticket h2"
    But I should not see "Make it shiny!"
